# Go Indy Demo

This is a demonstration website I built using Symfony 2 and Bootstrap 3.  It is
fully responsive, tested using Chromium's built-in device emulation.  I spent
most of the development time figuring out how to set up Symfony and Bootstrap
(~10% of the time) and finding/editing images (~50%-60% of the time).
Furthermore, I'd never used either Symfony or Bootstrap before.  Given that,
I'm rather impressed this went so quickly, and I credit Symfony and Bootstrap
for being so easy to work with.

# Disclaimer

I took none of these pictures and wrote very little copy for this site.  Its
sole purpose is to demonstrate what I can do development and design-wise, not
content-wise.
