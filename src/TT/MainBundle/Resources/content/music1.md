## The Vogue

The Vogue Nightclub in Broad Ripple is one of the most popular and storied
venues in the Midwest.  Since their opening in the late 70's, it has
continually been considered the top nightspot in Indy.  When they aren't
featuring amazing live acts, they shift into dance club mode; the Vogue's dance
nights are considered the place to be seen.
