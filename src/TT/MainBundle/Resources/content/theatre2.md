## Phoenix Theatre

Phoenix Theatre is a year-round, 30-year-old professional company presenting
live contemporary theatre in an intimate setting. From recent Broadway hits to
undiscovered gems from around the country, they produce emotionally engaging
works that are made even more powerful and compelling by the intimacy of their
130-seat Livia and Steve Russell Stage and their 65-seat cabaret style Frank
and Katrina Basile Stage.

The relaxed informal atmosphere also makes the theatre a great place to meet
friends, sip a glass of wine, and have a great conversation about what you just
saw.
