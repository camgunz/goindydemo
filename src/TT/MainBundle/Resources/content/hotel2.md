## Crowne Plaza - Union Station

Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, Crowne Plaza at Historic
Union Station is housed within the confines of an active train station, which
creates a unique experience for all guests. The muffled rumbling and subtle
vibrations of the trains as they roll through the building enhance the ambiance
of staying in our hotel ... where guests experience the authenticity of a
living railroad station.
