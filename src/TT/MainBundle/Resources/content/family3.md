## The Indianapolis Zoo

The Indianapolis Zoo has it all; it is the only institution accredited by the
Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and the American Alliance of Museums as
a zoo, an aquarium, and as a botanical garden.  Since opening in 1964, the
Indianapolis Zoo has emerged as a world-class facility hosting more than a
million visitors each year. The Zoo has also become a global leader in animal
conservation and research.  Your family will have a blast exploring its 64
acres, 16,000 plants, and over 2,000 animals!
