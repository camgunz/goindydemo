## Indiana Repertory Theatre

Indiana Repertory Theatre, frequently abbreviated IRT, is a professional
regional theatre that began as a genuine repertory theatre with its casts
performing in multiple shows at once.  It has subsequently become a regional
theatre and a member of the League of Resident Theatres.  The theatre is well
known in the state for their production of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol
as adapted by Tom Haas, a late IRT artistic director/member of the former
repertory company. It is a chamber theatre production modeled on David Edgar's
The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, that retains many of the story's
darkest elements, such as the scene featuring Want and Ignorance that Dickens
himself considered its heart, but is often omitted.  Come to Indy and see how
the story was meant to be told!
