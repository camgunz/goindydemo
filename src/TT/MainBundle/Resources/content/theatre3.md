## Q Artistry

This collective of theater artists presents original and re-imagined plays.
Quirky production styles and tongue-in-cheek humor are hallmarks of their work,
presented at the Historic Irvington Lodge, at Fringe, etc. Founded by Chicago
transplant Ben Asaykwee, Q Artistry blends unique elements such as puppetry,
original music, comedy and family-friendly programming to inspire and enlighten
theater-goers in Irvington and throughout the city. In addition, this group
sponsors a playwriting festival, where winners can see their plays produced as
part of Qâ€™s regular season.
